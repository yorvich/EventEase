EventEase is an application that allows users to browse events with details such as event name, date, and location and navigate seamlessly between pages like event details and registration. 

This app was developed in collaboration with Copilot, which assisted with the following aspects:

1. Creation of an EventCard component that implements two-way binding and uses a list of events provided by EventService
2. Implementation of the functionality to register new events and view a list of events
3. Creation of navigation links to view the list of events and navigate to the new event registration page
4. Inclusion of validations in the new event registration form
5. Improvements to the application's performance, specifically related to the display of the event list
6. Inclusion of state management in the application to allow track user session using local storage
7. Elimination of unnecessary dependencies
8. Use of best practices in the application code
9. Incorporation of the "Attendance Tracker" functionality
